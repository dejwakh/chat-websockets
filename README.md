Testing [socket.io](https://socket.io/get-started/chat)

A basic unsecure, public chatroom with several features:

1. a way to capture and save the username of every client that connects to the server,
2. A notification system that announces to all clients whenever a user enters or leaves the chat, as well as a report of all the users still connected
3. A way to make sure the same user isnâ€™t logged in twice (and not allow the second attempt)
